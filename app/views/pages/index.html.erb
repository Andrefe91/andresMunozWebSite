    <p>I&#39m a Structural Engineer by training, problem-solver by nature, and curious human by default. Born in Colombia, currently based in Australia, and always building something — whether it's a reinforced concrete frame, a project timeline, or a weirdly specific spreadsheet that somehow makes life easier.</p>
    <p>With over 10 years of experience in structural design (and a Master&#39s to back it up), I&#39ve tackled everything from urban infrastructure to housing projects. I&#39m recognized by Engineers Australia, which means I speak fluent load paths, detailing, and deadlines.</p>
    <p>But I don&#39t stop at technical. I like things that work and make sense — whether I&#39m modeling in 3D, sketching out concepts, or dabbling in frontend code just to see how it ticks. I learn fast, adapt faster, and I&#39m not afraid of a messy challenge (as long as there&#39s a plan to clean it up).</p>
    <p>Reliable, curious, and just a little obsessed with doing things the right way — if it needs building, organizing, or figuring out, I&#39m probably already on it.</p>

    <p>My career began at ESDILAB S.A.S, where I was involved in reviewing concrete structures and steel truss designs. I later served as a graduate assistant at the Colombian School of Engineering, overseeing materials testing and supporting research and development. During that time, I also taught a semester-long course on Introduction to Civil Engineering, aiming to inspire the next generation of engineers.</p>
    <p>Following this, I participated in the audit of a high-voltage transmission line project with Ingedisa S.A., assessing steel tower designs, concrete footings, and technical reports. As a freelance engineer, I have led the structural design of steel and concrete buildings in high seismic zones, including schools, public sports courts, and roofing systems. My work with local government entities such as InderHuila and the Neiva Mayor&#39s Office included reviewing designs and contributing to urban improvement projects like bikeways and recreational areas. Since 2020, I&#39ve continued to work independently, combining technical design with design verification across a range of structural projects.</p>
