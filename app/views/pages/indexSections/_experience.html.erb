<p>My career started at ESDILAB S.A.S, where I spent my days making sure concrete structures and steel trusses wouldn&#39t surprise anyone by collapsing. From there, I became a graduate assistant at the Colombian School of Engineering, where I got to torture-test materials in the lab and occasionally torture students with my "Introduction to Civil Engineering" course (they mostly survived).</p>
<p>I&#39ve audited high-voltage transmission lines with Ingedisa S.A, basically making sure those massive steel towers and lines can handle whatever Mother Nature throws at them. As a freelance engineer, I&#39ve designed everything from earthquake-resistant schools to public sports courts, working with local governments on projects that actually improve people&#39s daily lives.</p>
<p>Since 2020, I&#39ve been running my own practice, taking on structural design and verification projects across the board. Whether it&#39s a complex high-rise or a simple residential build, the goal stays the same: make it safe, make it work, and make sure everyone understands why it works that way.</p>
