<p>My career began at ESDILAB S.A.S, where I was involved in reviewing concrete structures and steel truss designs. I later served as a graduate assistant at the Colombian School of Engineering, overseeing materials testing and supporting research and development. During that time, I also taught a semester-long course on Introduction to Civil Engineering, aiming to inspire the next generation of engineers.</p>
<p>Following this, I participated in the audit of a high-voltage transmission line project with Ingedisa S.A., assessing steel tower designs, concrete footings, and technical reports. As a freelance engineer, I have led the structural design of steel and concrete buildings in high seismic zones, including schools, public sports courts, and roofing systems. My work with local government entities such as InderHuila and the Neiva Mayor&#39s Office included reviewing designs and contributing to urban improvement projects like bikeways and recreational areas. Since 2020, I&#39ve continued to work independently, combining technical design with design verification across a range of structural projects.</p>
