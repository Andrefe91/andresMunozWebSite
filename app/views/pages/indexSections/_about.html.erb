<p>I&#39m a Structural Engineer by training, problem-solver by nature, and curious human by default. Born in ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ Colombia, currently based in ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º Australia, and always building something â€” whether it's a reinforced concrete frame, a project timeline, or a weirdly specific spreadsheet that somehow makes life easier.</p>
<p>With over 10 years of experience in structural design (and a Master&#39s to back it up), I&#39ve tackled everything from urban infrastructure to housing projects. I&#39m recognized by Engineers Australia, which means I speak fluent load paths, detailing, and deadlines.</p>
<p>But I don&#39t stop at technical. I like things that work and make sense â€” whether I&#39m modeling in 3D, sketching out concepts, or dabbling in frontend code just to see how it ticks. I learn fast, adapt faster, and I&#39m not afraid of a messy challenge (as long as there&#39s a plan to clean it up).</p>
<p>Reliable, curious, and just a little obsessed with doing things the right way â€” if it needs building, organizing, or figuring out, I&#39m probably already on it.</p>
