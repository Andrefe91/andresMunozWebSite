<p>I turn complex engineering problems into solutions that actually workâ€”and I do it without putting anyone to sleep in the process.</p>
<p>I&#39m a structural engineer who&#39s spent over 10 years figuring out how to keep buildings upright, bridges from falling down, and projects from falling apart. Born in Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´, now based in Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º, with a Master&#39s degree and Engineers Australia recognition that proves I know the difference between a beam and a column (among other useful things).</p>
<p>Here&#39s the thing: engineering doesn&#39t have to be intimidating or boring, it can bring endless fascination. Whether I'm designing a school that can survive an earthquake, reviewing a transmission tower that needs to stand up to wind, or explaining why that crack in your wall might actually be fine, I believe in making the complex stuff make sense. I speak fluent load paths and deadlines, but I can also translate that into regular human language, most of the time at least.</p>
<p>When I&#39m not calculating concrete strengths or modeling structures in 3D, you'll find me tinkering with code, sketching out ideas, or creating systems that make chaotic projects run smoothly. I&#39m the engineer who actually enjoys the messy challenges, as long as we can clean them up properly afterward.</p>
